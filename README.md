# Indian Startup Eco-System Analysis 2018-2021

In this project, I explored the funding to Indian Start-ups from 2018 to 2021 to help my hypothetical team which is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem make an informed decision.

I used Python and Jupyter for this project.

# Column names and description:
Company/Brand: Name of the company/start-up. 

Founded: Year start-up was founded.

Sector: Sector of operation.

What it does: Description of Company.

Founders: Founders of the Company.

Investor: Investors.

Amount: Funds raised.

Stage: Round of funding.


# Hypothesis
H0: There is no relationship between the sector a startup belongs to and the type of funding received. 


# Conclusion
Accept the null hypothesis as the top three most funded sectors according to count (FinTech, EdTech  and E-commerce) and whereas the top three sectors in terms of funds (Fintech, Retail, Education).


# Recommendation
My recommendation to the team would be that Fintech startups received is where there was a substancial amounts of funding was distributed so that should be a sector that they can focus on. Retail and E-Commerce can be the other sectors to focus on as they received significant funding. A lot of funding was given in Series H and G this is based on the median amount across the different stages although when it comes to the stage with the most funding that was the Debt Stage. The beauty of debt is that the money will be paid back by the different companies within a stipulated time period.


Thank you.
